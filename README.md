## Notes

These notes are just here for your entertainment, they don't really serve any purpose other than giving you some facts that you properly already know from either reading comments in the python file or googling it.

- pyautogui screen capture will consume 100-200ms !
- OpenCV image manipulation also adds more time (like 100-200ms)
- CPU/System/Hardware dependent
- For now only "matching" on image templates no real AI

## Future examples?

These future examples is something i have though of could be cool to have here as well, some of them might be a bit out of scope.

- Regional capture, to optimize response time
- Confidence optimization
- AI learning of image template to match "evolving" content
- Matching capture/content in minimized windows
